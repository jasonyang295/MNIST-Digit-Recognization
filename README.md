# MNIST Digit Recognization in Python

This project is done in Python with the Numpy, Tensorflow, opencv and Matplot libraries. It reads handwritten numbers and classifies them from 0-9. A classic project involving neural network training and deep learning technique using the powerful Keras library.


# Implementation Details
Using 2 hidden layers and 1 ouput layer, the program trains a model that reads in images of handwritten digits. Certain parts of the neurons will experience more stimulation/detection and will map to a result (i.e a number) in the end. 

# How to use the program
Take the code, compile the file and run in terminal. You can also upload custom digit files for it to read in. I used 6 custom drawn digits that can be found in the digits.model folder in the main repo. There were only 6 digits, but other people have used hundreds to thousands to train their models, which you are free to do. Make sure to edit the code correspondingly if you do. For the digits, I used MS paint, but taking photos of hand-drawn photos would be better as MS paint was not the intended tool to write the digits for the program to read in.
