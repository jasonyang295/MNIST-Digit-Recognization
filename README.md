# MNIST Digit Recognization in Python

This project is done in Python with the Numpy, Tensorflow, opencv and Matplot libraries. It reads handwritten numbers and classifies them from 0-9. A classic project involving neural network training and deep learning techniques. 


# Implementation Details
Using 2 hidden layers and 1 ouput layer, the program trains a model that reads in images of handwritten digits. Certain parts of the neurons will experience more stimulation/detection and will map to a result (i.e a number) in the end. 

# How to use the program
Take the code, compile the file and run in terminal. You can also upload custom digit files for it to read in.
